What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize the repository, that is the time when the .git folder containing the
metadata is created. This needs to be done so that you can track files that are together.
This also shows you the recent commit made in the repository. This helps in version control.
If you have not cloned a repository in your system, you need to initialize the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and repository. What value do
you think it offers?

Working directory is a normal directory that doesnt not contain any files under the version
control tracking repository. It has an empty repository initialized, with no last committed 
files and all its contents listed under the untracked files. While files added to the repo
sitory are tracked together. They have version control system employed and different versions
of files committed. The staging area is an intermediate region, which gives us the provision 
to combine and commit the files that are logically related and so can easily be tracked.
