When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Remote repository maily deals with thelocation of the github, ie where to store and how 
to store. It is important to have the remote repository as we choose when to push or 
pull rather than github doing it. The remote repository alias name helps us in not 
memorizing the entire url to the repository.
